## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my last project of my Udacity's DataScience Nanodegree program. For this project, I was interestested in simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app to find the main characteristics of the customers who redem the mobile app offers. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 Jupyter notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the motivation project.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@juandiegocuellar02/how-was-the-tech-field-in-2017-in-terms-of-breach-salary-remote-working-and-languages-caa07d56fc8c).
